Haskell Question Set 1

1) Calculate the maximum value out of any 5 numbers.
	maximum [4,6,7,2,2]
	=> 7

2) Calculate the maximum value between any 2 numbers two different ways (intending you to use infix notation).
	6 `max` 5
	=> 6
	max 6 5
	=> 6

3) Calculate the next higher number than any negative number (for instance, -5 -> -4)
	succ (-5)
	=> -4

4) Write a function which will return the squared value of any number.
	sq = (^2)

5) Write a function which will return the sum of any two numbers.
	s2 x y = x + y
	
6) Write a function which will find the sum of any four numbers, but use #5's function to do it.
	s4 a b c d = s2 a b + s2 c d

7) Write a function which will calculate your letter grade in a class given a particular grade% as a parameter:  >=90 A, >= 80 B, >= 70 C, >= 60 D, others F
	grade x  = if ( x>= 90 ) then "A" else if (x>=80) then "B" else if (x>=70) then "C" else if (x>=60) then "D" else "F"

8) Calculate a list that contains 3, 1, 4, 1, 5, 9
	[3, 1, 4, 1, 5, 9]

9) Calculate the first letter in any string
	head "wormy"

10 )Calculate a list that can store this matrix:
3 1 4 1 5
9 2 6 5 3
5 8 9 7 9
	[[3,1,4,1,5], [9,2,6,5,3], [5,8,9,7,9]]

11 )Write a function which adds a given parameter to the end of a given list.
	append xs x = xs ++ [x]

12 )Write a function which adds a given parameter to the beginning of a given list.
	app2 xs x = [x] ++ xs

13 )What is the tail of "bubba"?
	"ubba"
14 )What is the init of "bubba"?
	"bubb"
15 )What is the head of "bubba"?
	'b'
16 )What is the last of "bubba"?
	'a'
